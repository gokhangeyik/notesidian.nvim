# Notesidian

A very simple Neovim plugin that I developed just for myself.
It helps me create daily notes or to-do lists using Obsidian templates and edit them from within Neovim.

Maybe I'll add more explanations and a few features in the future.

If you've stumbled upon this repo, please note that I didn't develop it for general use.
